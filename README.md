# Student Placement Analysis Project
## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student-related academic and professional data to identify factors influencing placement outcomes. The objective is to generate meaningful insights and build predictive models that can help understand student employability based on academic performance, skills, and internship experience.
## Data Gathering
The dataset used for this challenge is a student placement dataset containing simulated academic and professional profiles of college students. It includes attributes such as:
- Academic performance and CGPA
- Internship experience
- Communication and technical skills
- Placement status

This dataset is suitable as it directly aligns with the objective of analyzing student outcomes and supports both insight generation and prediction.
## Data Preparation & Quality Assurance
To ensure data quality and completeness, the following steps were carried out:
- Checked for missing values and ensured all essential fields were complete.
- Verified data types for numerical and categorical variables.
- Removed duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- Standardized column names and formats for consistency.
- Ensured logical consistency across features (e.g., academic scores within valid ranges).
These steps ensured that the dataset was clean, reliable, and ready for exploratory analysis and modeling.
## Identification of Key Metrics
The following key metrics were identified for analysis:
- CGPA and academic performance
- Internship experience
- Technical and communication skills
- IQ or aptitude-related scores
- Placement status (target variable)
These metrics help evaluate student readiness and employability.
## Key Questions for Insights & Predictions
The analysis aims to answer the following questions:
- What factors most strongly influence student placement outcomes?
- Does internship experience significantly improve placement chances?
- How does CGPA correlate with placement success?
- Can student placement status be accurately predicted using machine learning models?
- Are there distinct groups of students based on skills and performance?
